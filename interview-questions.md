# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does calling super do in a Ruby class?

Your answer: "I don't think I know that one! Would I be able to get back to you on that one once i've had time to check on it?"

Researched answer: Calling super inside a method of a particular class will invoke the same method defined in the class that's one level 'above' it. Seems like a nifty way to cut down on redundancy once things get super nest-y.
***Also, I 100% can't remember this, It may have been covered on the day I missed.***
2. What is a gem?

Your answer: A gem is Ruby's version of a package. A pre-packaged program or chunk of code, typically community-made.

Researched answer:  In Ruby, a gem is a library or application that provides a specific set of functionality, like a web framework or a testing library. Overall, gems make it easy to share and reuse code in the Ruby community. Rails is a great example.
**They're a lot like 'mods' that certain gaming communities make! One of the big reasons I wanted to learn how to code is to play around with modding games.**
3. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: A relational database is one that stores it's data in tables, similar to an Excel spreadsheet. While I'm sure there must be other types of databases, I do not know what they are at the moment.
**It's an excel spreadsheet that hates you.**
Researched answer: There are several other types of databases, including NoSQL databases that store data in formats other than tables, object-oriented databases that store data in the form of objects, and graph databases that store data in nodes and edges to represent entities and their relationships in a graph.

4. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer: Primary keys are the unique identifier for a specific bit of data. for example, you could have 30 different items in a database called "cheese", but if they are all 'keyed' correctly, then you can still differentiate between them! 
**if you lose your primary key, then you get to call a locksmith**
Researched answer: Primary keys are important for several reasons: they ensure the uniqueness of each row in a table, they help establish relationships between tables, and they allow for efficient querying of large datasets.

5. What are the HTTP verbs? What is each verb's corresponding CRUD action?

Your answer: HTTP: Get, Post, Put, Delete.   CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete
**Eat, Sleep, Code, Repeat**
Researched answer: Create/Post: Adding data. Read/Get: retrieving data. Update/Put: modifying data. Delete/Delete: Deleting Deleterious Data.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: RESTful routes are the URLs (or endpoints) that correspond to HTTP methods and CRUD operations.
**something I need much more of.**
2. Model validations: Sounds like testing, but for databases.

3. Params: Params (short for "parameters") refer to the input data that is submitted to a server as part of an HTTP request. It's the set of rules that you're asking the database to follow when looking up data.
**I could throw a thesaurus at you, but they really are just that simple. ¯\(ツ)/¯**
4. ERB: ERB is a templating language used in web development that allows developers to embed Ruby code within HTML, XML, or other text files.
 **this sounds like fun.**
5. API: The things that make stuff do stuff.
